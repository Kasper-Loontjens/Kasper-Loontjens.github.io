      <h2>"Om mig"</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Jag bor i en liten lägenhet i Staffanstorp tillsammans med fästmö,
          hund, katt och två ormar. Är väldigt spel-intresserad och det var
          genom spel som jag först blev introducerad till programmering, jag
          ritar även en del på datorn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jag umgås mycket med vänner och familj men kan verka väldigt osocial
          för dem som inte känner mig. Kan även vara lite smått tramsig ibland.
        </p>

          Placeholder*** Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I
          ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with
          her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead Well
          the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and
          I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your
          brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see
          So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you
          don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey now, you're an
          all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get
          the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting
          stars break the mold It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
          You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older But the meteor men beg
          to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we
          skate is getting pretty thin The water's getting warm so you might as
          well swim My world's on fire, how about yours? That's the way I like
          it and I'll never get bored Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game
          on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid All
          that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold Hey now,
          you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock
          star, get the show, on get paid And all that glitters is gold Only
          shooting stars Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
          I need to get myself away from this place I said, "Yup" what a concept
          I could use a little fuel myself And we could all use a little change
          Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the
          rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for
          fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so
          much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never
          know if you don't go (go!) You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey
          now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a
          rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold
          Only shooting stars break the mold And all that glitters is gold Only
          shooting stars break the mold ***Placeholder
